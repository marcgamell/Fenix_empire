Reinit \cite{laguna2016evaluating} provides functionality that is similar to 
Fenix', with these exceptions:
it assumes non-shrinking recovery, whereas Fenix can support shrinking and 
non-shrinking recovery within the same framework;
it does not offer facilities for data recovery, these have to be written by
the user; 
it is built directly into the MPI runtime, whereas Fenix is a library built
on top of MPI--the implementation currently uses ULFM, but the specification
does not expose that;
it changes the overal program structure, replacing main with calls to cleanup
handling and the original main program, whereas Fenix-enabled codes retain 
their original structure, and can be made to skip all fault tolerance
constructs via selective compilation (\texttt{\#ifdef}) or runtime tests.
